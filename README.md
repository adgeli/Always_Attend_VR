The purpose of this project is to explore the world of virtual reality and develop an applicable theme to current global circumstances. As the pandemic continues to evolve, many activities once taken for granted have become sought after experiences. 

Fortunatelty, the continuing advancements in the era of Digital Transformation allow societies to adapt to current situations and apply new methodologies to participate in common experiences. Through this lens, the design process of Always Attend VR was initiated.

Always Attend VR is a virtual reality expeirence designed to proivde soon-to-be married couples and their guests the possibility to attend destination weddings from their own homes. Always Attend VR brings guests to the destination ceremony wherever it may take place. The virutal reality experience allows the guest to take part of the ceremony and enjoy their friends and loved-ones company whilst doing so.

## Installation Requirements 

Always Attend VR is built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.

The project was developed and hosted on the [Glitch Platform](https://glitch/com) to view the code development and VR experience simultaneously. 

The simplicity of the platforms do not require local installations. Both platforms require users to have a ```GitHub``` account to begin developing their own projects. 

A helpful link for users to become familiarized with the A-Frame platform can be found [here](https://aframe.io/docs/1.1.0/introduction/)
